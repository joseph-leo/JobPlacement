# Live Project
### Project Introduction
From February 25th - March 8th, 2019 I worked in a team setting on a full scale ASP.NET MVC web application at the Tech Academy. Working on an existing codebase was a great way to get comfortable debugging unfamiliar code, refactoring working code, as well as implementing new features. This experience has shown me a lot about the agile methodology and has given me an appreciation for working on code collaboratively in a team setting. During this project we were given the opportunity to work on both front end and back end stories so I took advantage of this and spent time on both types of stories, including some that were a mixture of the two. This was a very valuable experience for me and because of this I am confident working with both front and back end code and using them in conjunction to create web applications. Along with practical coding knowledge, I also learned many useful skills that will help me in my career as a software developer.

Featured below are some stories I worked on over the live porject with code snippets to demonstrate what was accomplished.
